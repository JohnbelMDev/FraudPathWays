Explanation:
The dfs function traverses the grid recursively, marking visited cells.
Each time a 1 is encountered, a new pathway is started, and its size is calculated.
The grid is modified in place, marking visited cells to -1.
Output Example:
For the given grid:

yaml
Copy code
Number of Pathways: 4
Sizes of Pathways: [2, 3, 3, 2]
